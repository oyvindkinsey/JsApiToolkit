API
===

Api is project which seeks to provide a platform for building feature-rich
JavaScript API's similar to e.g. Facebook Connect.

The base implementation provides Cross-Document Messaging, and also supports
rendering interactive dialogs.

The project is currently in a early stage - it will be extended with a complete
build-environment suitable for buiding a production grade API.
